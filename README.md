# Sleep analysis with Python

After downloadlingd your personal samsung data, you have to get a file like this:

```bash
com.samsung.shealth.sleep.20251213163154.csv
```

Or a name like that. Rename it to `sleep.csv` and put it in the same folder as this script.

If your file starts with something like this:

```csv
com.samsung.shealth.sleep,6306007,11
```

Then remove it.
